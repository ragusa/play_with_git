This is the first commit into Master



Now I am working a modifying this file but I realize that I want it in a branch, not in Master . . .

So I did:
git stash
git stash branch my_new_branch

and added this comments to that file from my_new_branch. Now, I am about to commit in my new branch. Letâ€™s see what happens.
